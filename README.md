# pyODK
[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyodk.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyodk)

An API client for the [ODK Central API](https://odkcentral.docs.apiary.io). Use it to interact with your data and automate common tasks from Python.

This library aims to make common data analysis and workflow automation tasks as simple as possible by providing clear method names, types, and examples. It also provides convenient access to the full API using [HTTP verb methods](#raw-http-requests).

## Install

The currently supported Python version for `pyodk` is 3.8.

### From pip

```bash
pip install pyodk
```

### From source

```bash
# Get a copy of the repository.
mkdir -P ~/repos/pyodk
cd ~/repos/pyodk
git clone https://github.com/getodk/pyodk.git repo

# Create and activate a virtual environment for the install.
/usr/local/bin/python3.8 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install pyodk and its production dependencies.
cd ~/repos/pyodk/repo
pip install -e .

# Leave the virtualenv.
deactivate
```

## Configure

The configuration file uses the TOML format. The default file name is `.pyodk_config.toml`, and the default location is the user home directory. The file name and location can be customised by setting the environment variable `PYODK_CONFIG_FILE` to some other file path, or by passing the path at init with `Client(config_path="my_config.toml")`. The expected file structure is as follows:

```toml
[central]
base_url = "https://www.example.com"
username = "my_user"
password = "my_password"
default_project_id = 123
```

### Custom configuration file paths

The `Client` is specific to a configuration and cache file. These approximately correspond to the session which the `Client` represents; it also encourages segregating credentials. These paths can be set by:

- Setting environment variables `PYODK_CONFIG_FILE` and `PYODK_CACHE_FILE`
- Init arguments: `Client(config_path="my_config.toml", cache_path="my_cache.toml")`.

### Default project

The `Client` is not specific to a project, but a default `project_id` can be set by:

- A `default_project_id` in the configuration file.
- An init argument: `Client(project_id=1)`.
- A property on the client: `client.project_id = 1`.

### Session cache file

The session cache file uses the TOML format. The default file name is `.pyodk_cache.toml`, and the default location is the user home directory. The file name and location can be customised by setting the environment variable `PYODK_CACHE_FILE` to some other file path, or by passing the path at init with `Client(config_path="my_cache.toml")`. This file should not be pre-created as it is used to store a session token after login.

## Use

To get started with `pyODK`, build a `Client`:

```python
from pyodk.client import Client

client = Client()
```

Authentication is triggered by the first API call on the `Client`, or by explicitly using `Client.open()`.

Use `Client.close()` to clean up a client session. Clean up is recommended for long-running scripts, e.g. web apps, etc.

You can also use the Client as a context manager to manage authentication and clean up:

```python
with Client() as client:
    print(client.projects.list())
```

### Examples

**ðŸ‘‰ See detailed tutorials in the Examples library in the pyODK documentation.**

```python
from pyodk.client import Client

client = Client()
projects = client.projects.list()
forms = client.forms.list()
submissions = client.submissions.list(form_id=next(forms).xmlFormId)
form_data = client.submissions.get_table(form_id="birds", project_id=8)
comments = client.submissions.list_comments(form_id=next(forms).xmlFormId, instance_id="uuid:...")
client.forms.update(
  form_id="my_xlsform",
  definition="my_xlsform.xlsx",
  attachments=["fruits.csv", "vegetables.png"],
)
client.close()
```

### Raw HTTP requests
For interacting with parts of the ODK Central API ([docs](https://odkcentral.docs.apiary.io)) that have not been implemented in `pyodk`, use HTTP verb methods exposed on the `Client`:

```
client.get("projects/8")
client.post("projects/7/app-users", json={"displayName": "Lab Tech"})
```
You can find a more detailed tutorial in the Examples library in the pyODK documentation.

These methods provide convenient access to `Client.session`, which is a `requests.Session` object subclass. The `Session` has customised to prefix request URLs with the `base_url` from the pyodk config. For example with a base_url `https://www.example.com`, a call to `client.session.get("projects/8")` gets the details of `project_id=8`, using the full url `https://www.example.com/v1/projects/8`.

### Session customization
If Session behaviour needs to be customised, for example to set alternative timeouts or retry strategies, etc., then subclass the `pyodk.session.Session` and provide an instance to the `Client` constructor, e.g. `Client(session=my_session)`.


### Logging
Errors raised by pyODK and other messages are logged using the `logging` standard library. The logger is in the `pyodk` namespace / hierarchy (e.g `pyodk.config`, `pyodk.endpoints.auth`, etc.). The logs can be manipulated from your script / app as follows.

```python
import logging

# Initialise an example basic logging config (writes to stdout/stderr).
logging.basicConfig()
logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Get a reference to the pyodk logger.
pyodk_log = logging.getLogger("pyodk")

# Receive everything DEBUG level and higher.
pyodk_log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
pyodk_log.propagate = True

# Ignore everything below FATAL level.
pyodk_log.setLevel(logging.FATAL)
pyodk_log.propagate = False
```

### Errors raised by pyODK
Error types raised by pyODK are found in `errors.py`, which currently is only the `PyODKError`. In general this error is raised when:

- The pyODK configuration is invalid (missing file, missing fields, etc).
- The client method arguments are invalid (missing, wrong type, etc.).
- The response from ODK Central indicated and error (HTTP >=400, <600).
- The data returned from ODK Central does not have the expected fields or types.

Note that pyODK does not attempt to wrap every possible error condition, so if needed, broader exception handling should be included in your script / app.
